      "description": "If you are or know someone who is dealing with a lot of grains and powders, you most likely use one of these on a regular basis. If you have a bag of rice or flour, how will you know it’s not going to mold? Well, we wouldn’t know until we measure the content with a moisture meter. This is why we try our best to provide quality meters to improve your lives without having to spend a fortune.\r\n\r\nWhether it is for industrial use or households, we guarantee this meter will get the job done. Accurate meters like these will definitely benefit households and our goal is to provide these meters for not only industrial use, but also regular households.\r\n\r\nIf your family is into baking and culinary activities, this meter will come in great use. Most households, including our own office, have a lot of products which can potentially absorb too much moisture.This digital moisture meter is also ideal for measuring for example sand, soil, grains, flour, rice or anything powdered. You can simply just take it out of the box and start using it, no calibration or settings needed. It is so easy we sometimes question the reviews and technical questions online.\r\n\r\nThe digital moisture meter does not allow savings of data but instead there is a simple hold function that gives you time to see the reading, even if you remove the sensors away from the sample. We recommend this meter to anyone who cares and want to have a fresh and safe household.",

Diagnostics can be performed via OBD-II connector (which can be found close to the steering wheel) or via manufacturer specific connector (only older vehicles, pre-2001). Compared with other universal vehicle scanner equipment that just read fault codes, lexia 3 pps2000 works almost all the functions such as the original dealer diagnostic tool. Lexia 3 pps2000 interface contains K-Line multiplexor, CAN-BUS interfaces and SAE J1850 bus (both PWM and VPW). Read fault codes: Displays all stored and pending fault codes with complete description (e.g. \"Rail pressure - too low pressure\"). Program supports report printing or copy to clipboard. Clear fault codes: This function clears all stored fault codes and other diagnostic information. Read identification Displays complete identification of control unit, e.g. part number, software/hardware version, manufacturer, etc.. Measured Values: Program displays live Data like Engine Speed, Battery voltage, Oxygen Sensor, Coolant Temperature, etc. Values can be displayed in graph, 9 values at once, or full listing (all measured values). Logging to file is also supported, which allows offline analysis. Programming functions/Adaptation: This feature is of great importance in all vehicles because systems like Engine control units, Immobilizers, Airbags, Alarms, Body Control Units, and some others, require you to perform reset or programming procedures after car repair is done, or even configuration after replacing broken Control Unit. Auto-scan (complete car scan/test):Detects all ECUs (electronic control units) installed in car and reads all diagnostic fault codes.

      "description": "Thermo hygrometers are useful for measurement of humidity. Humidity is a representation of the concentration of water vapour in the air where the value is shown as a percent. Thermo hygrometers have sensors which measure humidity of the air and temperature of the air. Both values will be shown as a digital representation and converted into the desired unit. The result will then be shown via display. Thermo hygrometers are versatile in that they can take measurements, store them to memory and transfer data to computer for further detailed analysis. Most of our instruments are contactless working which enables non-destructive measurements. Without this option you would not be able to analyze your data over such a long period of time.\r\nThermo hygrometers are very useful in evaluating damage in a warehouse, cold rooms and Datacentres. These need to be at an exact temperature, with a specific level of humidity. A difference in temperature and / or humidity would mean that the device/stored products get damaged or even destroyed. Such ware housing facilities are for example those ones that offer pharmaceutical drugs, flowers and food. A change in temperature can affect the stored drug, Foul food would mean additional payment for a reseller of groceries and dried flower mean that the seller of those ones will be unable to sell them. With the high accuracy of our products such businessmen will easily be able to determine the surroundings of such goods and control parameters like temperature and humidity in a better way.\r\nUsing Thermo-Hygrometer devices you can measure relative humidity, determine the source of damp and moisture problems and indicate whether moisture reduction and control strategies are effective. Hygrometers are used to measure moisture vapour within the air, also known as the humidity level, this is measured on a scale of 0 to 100% relative humidity with 100% being saturated air. The digital Thermo-Hygrometers that can show minimum, maximum and current values of humidity. Dew Point is another value the device show, it is a measure of the point when the water vapor in the air condenses so much that it is condensed into liquid water this is the saturation point for the air at that specific temperature.\r\nTherefore, Thermo-hygrometer can also be applied in private households. In househoulds, the temperature and humidity or moisture content is also important. Pleasant air temperature and air humidity is only one example. The optimal environmental conditions for human-beings are around 20 °C and 50-65 % air humidity. In addition to that, mould growth starts at 70% air humidity. It is very difficult to control the environmental conditions in a living or bathroom as well as in a cellar. With the help of thermo-hygrometer devices, these conditions can easily be displayed and moreover controlled. If the air humidity is too high, you can for example open a window. If it is too low, an air humidifier can be used. Thermo-Hygrometers can be used to measure moisture content in various materials including wood, concrete, plaster and bricks.",
